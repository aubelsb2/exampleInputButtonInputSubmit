Certainly! Here's a simple one-file Go project that demonstrates the difference between an HTML input's `type="button"` and `type="submit"` when used with an HTTP server:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"html/template"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", indexHandler)
	http.HandleFunc("/process", processHandler)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}

func indexHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	tmpl := template.Must(template.ParseFiles("index.html"))
	tmpl.Execute(w, nil)
}

func processHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if r.Method == "POST" {
		r.ParseForm()
		name := r.FormValue("name")
		action := r.FormValue("action")

		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Name: %s\n", name)
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Action: %s\n", action)
	}
}
```

In this example, we have two HTTP request handlers: `indexHandler` and `processHandler`.

The `indexHandler` is responsible for rendering the `index.html` template, which contains a simple HTML form with two buttons - one with `type="button"` and the other with `type="submit"`. The form also has an input field for a name.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Button vs Submit</title>
</head>
<body>
	<form action="/process" method="post">
		<input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name" required><br><br>
		<input type="button" name="action" value="Button">
		<input type="submit" name="action" value="Submit">
	</form>
</body>
</html>
```

The `processHandler` handles the form submission. It checks the HTTP method of the request (which should be "POST" for form submissions) and then retrieves the form values. It writes the name and action values back to the response.

To run the program, save the above code in a file named `main.go`, and create an `index.html` file in the same directory with the provided HTML code.

Then, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are saved. Execute the following command to build and run the Go program:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Once the program is running, open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the HTML form with the "Button" and "Submit" buttons. Enter a name in the input field and click each button to observe the difference in behavior.

When you click the "Button" button, the form will not be submitted. However, when you click the "Submit" button, the form will be submitted, and you will see the form values (name and action) displayed on the page.

This demonstrates that the `type="button"` input does not trigger form submission, while `type="submit"` does.
